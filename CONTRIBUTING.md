## Building the site

The registry site uses [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/),
a Ruby based static site generator, with [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs).

### Docker dev

You can use the following Docker command to build and serve the site:

```shell
docker run -p 4000:4000 -v $(pwd):/site bretfisher/jekyll-serve
```

### Local Ruby dev

You will need to set up Ruby locally to run the server and see your changes.

```bash
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

With all the gems (dependencies) installed, you can launch the jekyll server.

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

It will show output like this, and you can grab the Server address
and open it in your browser.

## Adding New Entries to the Registries

To add a new entry to the registries (either an OpenAPI
Specification Extension namespace or a specific OpenAPI
Specification Extension),
fork this repository in GitHub.
Make a local clone of your fork and check out the
`main` branch.

### Add a New Extension Namespace Registry Entry

Working in the `main` branch,
add a new Markdown file in `registries/_namespace/`. The file name
should be the namespace name with a `.md` extension, without the `x-`
prefix.
For example, to add an extension namespace `abc` for extensions named `x-abc-*`,
create `registries/_namespace/abc.md`. Use the following template,
replacing the instruction text in `<<instruction-text>>` markers:

```md
---
owner: <<Your-GitHub-username>>
issue:
description: <<Briefly describe your namespace>>
layout: default
---

{% capture summary %}
The `x-{{page.slug}}-` prefix is reserved for extensions created by
<<describe your organization and namespace>>
{% endcapture %}

{% include namespace-entry.md summary=summary %}
```

You may use [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
in the short and long descriptions.

See [oai.md](https://github.com/OAI/spec.openapis.org/blob/main/registries/_namespace/oai.md?plain=1)
for an example for the `x-oai-*` namespace.

Next, locally build
the site as described above and view
[http://127.0.0.1:4000/registry/namespace/index.html](http://127.0.0.1:4000/registry/namespace/index.html)
to verify your namespace is listed.
(Modify the URL if Jekyll is running on a different IP or port.)
The namespace name in __Value__ column
should link to your namespace page, and the __Description__
text should be the `description:` from the Markdown frontmatter.

Preview your content at
`http://127.0.0.1:4000/registry/namespace/abc.html`
(change `abc` to your namespace name in the URL).

### Add a New Specification Extension Registry Entry

add a new Markdown file in `registries/_extension/`.
The file name should be your specification extension name with
a `.md` file extension, such as
`registries/_extension/x-abc-wander.md` to document the
`x-abc-wander` extension.

Use this template for your file,
replacing the instruction text in `<<instruction-text>>` markers:

```md
---
owner: <<Your-GitHub-username>>
issue:
description: <<Brief description of your Specification Extension>>.
schema:
  <<JSON Schema, in YAML format, for validating specification extension instances>>
 objects: <<Array of OAS objects where the specification may be used.>>
layout: default
---

{% capture summary %}
<<Detailed description of the extension.>>

Used by: (informational)

 * <<bullet list of representative users of the extension>>>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture example %}

<<YAML snippet of OpenAPI source code example showing use of your specification example>

{% endcapture %}

{% include extension-entry.md summary=summary example=example %}
```

You may use [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
in the short and long descriptions.

See [x-twitter.md](https://github.com/OAI/spec.openapis.org/blob/main/registries/_extension/x-twitter.md?plain=1)
for an example.

Build the site locally as described above.

Preview [http://127.0.0.1:4000/registry/extension/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/registry/extension/).

(Modify the URL if Jekyll is running on a different IP or port.)
Verify that your specification extension
is listed. The __Value__ column should contain your extension name
with a link to your documentation, such as
`http://127.0.0.1:4000/registry/extension/x-abc-wander.html`,
and the __Description__ should be your brief description.
